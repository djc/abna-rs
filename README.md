# ABN Amro mutations retrieval

This Rust library enables retrieval of mutations from the Dutch ABN Amro
banking site using the "soft token" (5-digit pass code).

This library was created by and is maintained by Dirkjan Ochtman. If you are
in a position to support ongoing maintenance and further development or use it
in a for-profit context, please consider supporting my open source work on
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/djc) or
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dochtman).

It was ported from [a Python implementation](https://github.com/djc/abna) I also created.
